# Decision Tree C5 Algorithm – Decision Support System

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the C5 decision tree algorithm to support structured decision-making processes. The system evaluates multiple input attributes and applies rule-based logic to determine the most suitable outcome based on defined criteria.

Originally implemented to determine the best candidate for a specific job position, the same decision logic can be applied to other domains such as risk assessment, eligibility scoring, policy evaluation, and operational decision support systems.

## Use Case
- Candidate or eligibility assessment
- Rule-based decision support
- Risk or suitability scoring
- Data-driven classification problems

## Key Features
- Implementation of the C5 decision tree algorithm
- Attribute-based classification
- Transparent rule generation for explainable decisions
- Suitable for integration into backend systems as decision logic

## Relevance to Financial & Insurance Systems
Decision tree algorithms like C5 are commonly used in financial and insurance environments to:
- Support risk assessment decisions
- Evaluate eligibility criteria
- Improve consistency and fairness in automated decision-making
- Enhance explainability of system decisions

## Technologies Used
- Algorithmic classification logic
- Data preprocessing
- Decision tree modelling

## Notes
This project focuses on decision logic and algorithmic reasoning. It can be extended or integrated into Java-based backend systems, APIs, or cloud-deployed services.
